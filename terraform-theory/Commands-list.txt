terraform import:
In Terraform, you need to import an existing resource into your Terraform configuration so that you can manage it with Terraform. "terraform import" command is useful when you have an existing resource that you did not create with Terraform, but you want to manage its lifecycle with Terraform.
syntax: 
                terraform import <resource_type>.<logical_name> <id/name>
